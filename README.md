## The Maze project


> Description : The objective of this project is to develop a 2D game using raycasting techniques! You're not required to follow the tasks sequentially, except for the initial one (naturally), or if a task relies on a preceding one. Beneath the Tips and Links section, you'll find a link to an excellent and comprehensive tutorial on raycasting. Take your time to thoroughly understand it and get some hands-on practice! Above all, enjoy the process of working on this projectâ€”it's meant to be an engaging and enjoyable experience!
